/*  THE CITED WRITER'S RULES, PROVED WITHOUT A KEY (2026-10-24). A planted draft for the fair-crown pair
    (Messi 16/17 v Neymar 16/17, the page names Messi) and one for an inside-margin pair, with the narrow
    check stubbed to answer as Sonnet should. Each planted fault must be deleted for its own reason, the
    clean sentences kept, and the rejection rule must fire exactly when it should. Needs the fresh
    capture (sample.js --capture), no key.  */
